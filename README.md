This repository provides datasets and original codes that support the results presented in: "Harnessing ultrasound-derived hydroxyl radicals for the selective oxidation of aldehyde functions." (Preprint version at: 10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-01sv9)

A description of the contents, as quoted from the main text of the article, is:

"These datasets and original codes include: DFT output files for stationary points needed to generate kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, for the basis set convergence test, and for and additional calculations reported; the Jupyter notebook and dependences to generate the input files for microkinetic model implemented in MATLAB and outputs at LFUS (20 kHz) and HFUS (580 kHz); the microkinetic model implemented in MATLAB for generating reaction rates and trends; the kinetic and thermodynamic coefficients evaluated at 315 K and 325 K and inputs to MKM model; and the python code for calculating van der Waals volumes."
